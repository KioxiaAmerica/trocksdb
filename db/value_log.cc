  // The tricky part is when the ring has to grow owing to growth in the database.  We don't want Get() to have to acquire a lock,

  // still using the previous ring, a valid reference in the new ring to a slot that doesn't exist in the old ring will be aliased
  // to an incorrect slot in the old ring.  This is very unlikely because the ring grows in the middle of compaction and the
  // references to new slots are not available to the user until the compaction is finished and versioned; but on non-Intel machines that
  // have loose memory coherence it is possible that a stale cache might persist for long enough to make trouble.

  RandomAccessFile *selectedfile;  // this will be the pointer to the file, once we have validated everything

  // We use acquire/release memory ordering on all accesses to the ring pointers (acquire for load, release for store).  This memory ordering means
  // that if we load a value X, we can be sure that subsequent reads to ANY memory (not just ring pointers) will see any store by the writer of X that happened before the
  // store to X.  It doesn't mean that the load gets the 'current' value, whatever that would mean; in particular, if a store is in flight, a second load from the same address
  // might return a different value even though no new store has been issued anywhere.
  //
  // The way to think of this is: if I load x=a and y=b with acquire/release ordering, the value of y may be from a later value of b than the one in effect when x was loaded,
  // but it can never be from an earlier value of b.

    //  an Intel architecture with its strict concurrency rules, this problem will never show up because there is a long delay between the time a file is created and
    //  the first time it can be referenced; but on a permissive-concurrency architecture it is possible, especially if a core wakes up after a delay with stale data in caches.
    //  We should wait a very short time and retry.
